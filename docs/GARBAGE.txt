Garbage works more or less like this.

When a player makes a combo or chain, garbage is sent to the opponent.
Garbage blocks will be named Kb for a 1xK rod, or KRb for a block of K rows.
Rb rods made of metal are denoted M.

The amount of garbage is as follows:

4-combo: 3b
5-combo: 4b
6-combo: 5b
7-combo: Rb
8-combo: 3b + 4b
9-combo: 2 * 4b
10-combo: 2 * 5b
11-combo: 5b + Rb
12-combo: 2 * Rb
13-combo: 3 * Rb
14-to-19-combo: 4 * Rb
20-to-24-combo: 6 * Rb
K-chain: (K-1)Rb
K metal blocks in combo: (K-2)M in addition to normal combo garbage

For the purposes of this document, assume P1 is dropping garbage on P2.

The garbage is not dropped instantly once it is awarded.
It is, however, displayed above P2's
stack N frames after it is awarded.     #TODO: find N.

First, the garbage will wait for P1's chain to end.

Then all the garbage that was created during P1's chain will wait until
the most recent combo or chain (in this set of garbage)
was at least M frames ago.              #TODO: find M.

Then, all the garbage will wait until P2's chain to end.

At this time, after Q frames, the       #TODO: find Q.
garbage will fall into P2's stack.

A few things worth noting about the above process:
- It is possible to skip the second stage altogether if P1's
    chain is of any respectable length.
- Multiple chains worth of garbage may accumulate in the third
    stage if P1 makes short chains or unchained combos
    while P2 is making a long chain.

To find precise garbage timings I will probably have to use a debugger.
